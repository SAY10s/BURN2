/**
 * Generates a new `AttackData` object based on the provided attack properties.
 *
 * This function calculates the offensive stat and skill for the actor character
 * based on the weapon's associated skill, determines which statuses are applied
 * based on their chances, and initializes various roll and modifier fields for
 * the attack process.
 *
 * @param attackDataProp - The base attack data containing information about the actor,
 *   weapon, and initial attack parameters. SEE REMARKS.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The `attackDataProp` received from the client contains only the following fields:
 * - `targetCharacterID`: ID of the target character (string)
 * - `weapon`: selected weapon object (Weapon)
 * - `typeOfAttack`: selected type of attack (TypesOfAttack)
 * - `typeOfDamage`: selected type of damage (TypesOfDamage)
 * - Additionally this param HAS TO ALREADY INCLUDE `actorCharacterID` (string) that is derived from the socket.
 * @returns A new `AttackData` object with calculated offensive/defensive stats,
 *   rolls, modifiers, and applied statuses. SEE REMARKS.
 * @remarks
 * The returned `AttackData` object doesn't include the defensive stats.
